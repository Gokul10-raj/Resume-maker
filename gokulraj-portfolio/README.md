# Gokulraj — Portfolio

A clean, fast, multi‑page portfolio template (no frameworks). Edit the HTML files and ship.

## Quick start
1. Unzip and open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Search “Gokulraj” and replace with your name if needed.
3. Update links in the header, footer, and `contact.html`.

## Customize
- Colors live in `assets/styles.css` under `:root`.
- Avatar is `assets/avatar.svg`. Swap with any image (same filename) for instant update.
- Add or remove cards in `projects.html` by duplicating `<article class="card">…</article>` blocks.

## Deploy
- **GitHub Pages:** push to a repo and enable Pages.
- **Netlify/Vercel:** drag‑and‑drop the folder.
- **Any host:** upload as static files.
